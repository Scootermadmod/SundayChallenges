# Sunday Challenges
On Sundays, I sometimes take a break from working on my main project to quickly prototype something simple. A lot of the time, this is a way for me to test an idea that eventually gets rolled into other projects.

A good example of this would be the [Tiny X-Wing project](https://github.com/brihernandez/TinyXWingClean), which was designed to test the idea of loading JSON files that affected gameplay such as ship speed and weapon damage. This project informed a lot of the architecture and design decisions that ultimately led to many features of Tiny Combat Arena becoming driven by external human-readable files.

Some projects might be streamed on my YouTube page. If they are, the associated stream will be linked as well. Click on the `Project Source` link for each project to see more details and the source code.

Flight physics that strike a medium between arcade and simulator. Loosely based on the physics from the classic Jane's series of flight simulators.
